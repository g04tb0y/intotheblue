# NOTES

Working memory for this project. See `CLAUDE.md` for how it's used. Git holds the
detailed change history; this file holds rationale, plans, and open questions.

## TODO

- [ ] Push pending local commits to `origin/devel` (branch is a few commits ahead).
- [ ] Optional: make the `csv/` export order match the on-screen discovery order
      (currently CSV is sorted by RSSI).

## Design decisions

- **Python 3.10 pinned** (`.venv310/`) — `pc-ble-driver-py` (native lib under blatann)
  ships no wheels for ≥ 3.11. Non-negotiable until that changes upstream.
- **Two hardware backends, kept separate** — nRF52 Connectivity dongle (serial, via
  blatann) for BLE; host BlueZ adapter (`bluetoothctl`) for Classic. Do not conflate.
- **Dongle stays open across an interaction** — pause the scan and connect on the same
  `BleDevice`. Closing then reopening immediately fails with
  `NrfError.rpc_h5_transport_state`; this drove the whole scan→pause→act→resume design.
- **Table keeps discovery order** (no live RSSI re-sort) so rows don't jump under the
  cursor during selection.
- **Shared `livetable` scanner interface** — new scan surfaces implement
  `snapshot/is_scanning/pause/resume/save_csv` instead of duplicating the curses UI.
- **Passive/active boundary** — passive analysis (`exposure.py`, record enrichment)
  must not transmit; anything that connects/writes sits behind an explicit user action.
  Heavy active primitives (e.g. L2CAP flooding) live in external, dedicated tooling.
- **English for code and all UI text.**

## Open questions — to study / evaluate

- **OUI vendor lookup** for public (non-random) addresses — would identify the vendor
  from the MAC even without manufacturer data; needs a local IEEE OUI database.
- **Service-UUID → SIG name** in the scan table (blatann has assigned-number tables;
  already used for GATT names in `client.py`, not yet surfaced in the scan columns).
- **TX Power** is not exposed directly by blatann's `AdvertisingData` in this version —
  would need to parse it out of the raw advertising records.
- **Class of Device minor** decoding covers only common majors (`scan_classic._MINOR`);
  extend as needed.
- **Roadmap depth**: active enumeration, richer peripheral/server interaction, and
  device cloning/emulation — all still to be designed into the scan/select/act model.

## Actions log

- Initial bench built: BLE scan (batch + live), Classic scan, GATT client browser,
  peripheral emulation, interactive scan→select→act workflow, Fast Pair identification,
  passive Fast Pair GATT exposure check. (Details in git history on `devel`.)
- Added BLE **capability fingerprint** (`capabilities.py`): connects, enumerates GATT,
  matches a signature registry (DFU/OTA, HID, NUS, OTS, DIS, Mesh, IPSP, LE Audio,
  Media/Telephony) + attack-surface notes. Detection-only. Registry is extensible.
- Added Classic **profile capability enumeration** (`capabilities.classic_report` +
  `scan_classic.read_profiles`): parses SDP `UUID:` lines from `bluetoothctl info`
  into a profile checklist (A2DP/AVRCP/HFP/SPP/OBEX/PBAP/MAP/HID/PAN/SAP/DID).
  Detection-only. Parser validated against real soundbar output.
